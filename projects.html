            <h3> DHCP Relay Enhancement for ns-3 </h3>

            <ul>
	      <li>Project: Enabling Support for relays in DHCP as an enhancement to ns-3</li>
	      <li>Students: GVS Tushaar, Ujjwal Pasupulety</li>
              <li>Mentor: <a href="https://adeepkit01.github.io">Ankit Deepak</a> </li>
	      <li>Abstract: Improving on the current implementation of DHCP in ns-3, the aim is to add the enhancement of
		  including relays in a given network. It is advantageous to use the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
		  as defined in RFC 2131 to assign customer premise host IP addresses in this environment.
		  However, a number of security and scaling problems arise with such "public" DHCP use. RFC 3046 proposed
		  relay-agent option that extends the set of DHCP options as defined in RFC 2132.

		  The new option is called the Relay Agent Information option and is inserted by the DHCP relay agent when
		  forwarding client-originated DHCP packets to a DHCP server. Servers recognizing the Relay Agent
		  Information option may use the information to implement IP address or other parameter assignment policies. 
		  The DHCP Server echoes the option back verbatim to the relay agent in server-to-client replies,
		  and the relay agent strips the option before forwarding the reply to the client.
